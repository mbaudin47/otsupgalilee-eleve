 library providing state-of-the-art implementations of graphical models 
 for decision making, including Bayesian Networks, Markov Networks 
 (Markov random fields), Influence Diagrams, Credal Networks, 
 Probabilistic Relational Models. The framework also contains a wrapper, 
 pyAgrum for exploiting aGrUM in Python. This framework is the result of 
 an ongoing effort to build an efficient and well maintained open source 
 cross-platform software, running on Linux, MacOS X and Windows, for 
 dealing with graphical models and for providing essential components to 
 build new algorithms for graphical models.}
